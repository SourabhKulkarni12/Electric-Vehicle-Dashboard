ðŸš— **Electric Vehicle Dashboard**

A powerful, interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the growth, distribution, and adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) globally and regionally. The Electric Vehicle Population Dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, businesses, and enthusiasts explore EV population dynamics through compelling visual analytics.

**Project Overview**

This project leverages Tableau to build a comprehensive dashboard analyzing EV registrations, market trends, and infrastructure readiness. It enables data-driven decision-making by visualizing key indicators such as:
* Total Electric Vechicle.
* Average Range of the Vechicle.
* Total Battery Electric Vechicle (BEV) and their %.
* Total Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vechicle (PHEV) and their %.
* Clean Alternative Fuel Vechicle (CAFV) complianed Vechicles.

  **Objectives**
  Identify high-growth regions for EV adoption.
* Analyze EV population distribution and density.
* Compare EV adoption rates with charging infrastructure availability.
* Track the rise of top-selling EV models and brands.
* Provide insights for strategic planning, policy formulation, or market research.
